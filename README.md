## JUST NOTES AT THIS STAGE

- look at setting up a monorepo tool to share node_modules (turborepo, nx, pnpm workspaces, yarn workspace)
- Setup kubeconfig on local machine - this requires that you copy the `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` from master machine to your local machine and `export KUBECONFIG=path/to/file`
